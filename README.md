This project applies machine learning algorithms to the Air Quality UCI and Water Potability datasets to develop predictive models for assessing air quality and determining water potability. The datasets were preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, and various feature engineering techniques were applied. Models including decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results highlight the best-performing models, contributing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and public health safety. Key skills applied include machine learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
