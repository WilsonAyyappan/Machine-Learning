This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms on two datasets: the Air Quality UCI dataset and the Water Potability dataset. The primary goal was to develop predictive models that accurately assess air quality levels and determine the potability of water samples based on their chemical properties. To achieve this, the datasets were meticulously preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, and various feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance model performance. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods, were implemented and evaluated. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, highlighting the best-performing models for each dataset. This comparative analysis aimed to identify the most suitable algorithms for predicting air quality and water potability, thereby contributing valuable knowledge for environmental monitoring and public health safety.
